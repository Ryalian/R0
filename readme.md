# Project O

Project O is a personal project to build all kind of fun stuff with a full stack platform. Current stage(Engine) is R0.
The project will be deployed to [https://twice.live](http://twice.live)

This page is the roadmap of the app. To see how mechanics works, please read [here](./appSrc/app/readme.md)

R0 will be the version below 1.0:
  - v0.1 Set up basic React, webpack and express - Done
  - v0.2 Set up basic wireframe of state, action, engine and dirac sea(item pool, aka DS). See detail below - Done
  - v0.3 Set up Nginx proxy - Done
  - v0.4 Write agenda of the project - Done
  - v0.5 Big version change for first app - Calendar!
### v0.5 *My Calendar App*
> v0.5 Will be a examination of if everything about this framework can be chained together

  - v0.5.0 Create data model for experience (Backend)
  - v0.5.1 Display item in dirac sea (Frontend API call)
  - v0.5.2 Basic layout for dirac sea items
  - v0.5.3 Implement state for the application(Filter, Sorting, etc.)
  - v0.5.4 Add detail to DS item
  - v0.5.5 Event handler for DS item(modal, notification, etc)
  - v0.5.6 Implement Action for the application(Add, edit, Remove DS item). No actual change to the data
  - v0.5.8 Implement database to replace hardcoded data. Action actually works.
 
 First Application should be ready for delivery at this point. App will get small clean up until 1.0

  - v0.6 Create home page, make application selectable. Implementation of Router!
  - v0.7 Basic function of core Engine(SOUL!)
  - Account login, share the app with others :) -Must have :3 

### v0.7 is *critical* but also *unknown*
Original plan is scrapped, need to rethink
 
After v0.7 R0 is complete! Not so fast...

  - v0.9 Test cases, unit test

# v1.0.0 -  *1000000001th TODO List* Engine R1
> Yes, I am gonna make the 1000000001th TODO List App. 
> It's the last one in this planet I promise. 
> Well, hopefully.

### TODO List candidates (Priority: unknown)
  - Add & remove item (1st thing of course) -Must have
  - Event information(time, location blah, blah) -Must have
  - Alert -Optional
  - Calendar(Absolutely the last thing to work on, I may put it on v10.10.10) -Optional
  
  <!-- below is not decided yet just some thought -->
### v2.0.0 *Voting App*
> Hopefully I can get this far. I will close the github to private since it's containing account system in this stage.

  - v2.0 Topic List (hardcoded)
  - v2.1 Topic Creation page
  - v2.2 Text only topic voting interface
  - v2.3 Add details to the interface
  - v2.3 Add photo-text mixed topic
  
 ##### Planned features for later version:
   - Video based topic(*We will have a video player app as v4.0*)
   - Audio based topic(*same as above*)
   - Share link
   - Location based photo comment(click and comment)
   
> By here, I should consider about making an mobile app or progressive web app

# v3.0 *Data mining and Core Engine update* Engine R2
v3.0 will be a backend update for data analising. So far all the developments are based on front end. To improve the UX and data value, certain level of data mining is required. Also, the core of this project is Core Engine. I should update it to at lease Chatbot level and evolve to AI in the future.

# v4.0 *Video Function*
This is my most desired project! Only reason putting it to v4.0 is because it will cost a lot(T T). There will be a version system of this app based on the comment voting system so everyone can branch out the original version and create their own topic. This app will also contains a lot of editing functions. It's where action engine shines. The function here will out run youtube if they are still not moving forward. This is also the stage where I would start exploring opportunity to create profit(depend on how many user I have, I expect 10).

Everything TBD but:
# The video should be in the center of the screen!!!!!!!
